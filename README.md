# # Sabermetrics Visualization and Modeling

This project aims to analyze and visualize baseball data using sabermetrics, a field of study that focuses on advanced baseball statistics. The project utilizes data from Retrosheet, which provides datasets dating as far back as 1870.

## Installation

To run the code and reproduce the visualizations, you need to have the following packages installed:

- plotly
- nbformat
- statsmodels
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scipy

You can install these packages using pip:


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the project files.
2. Install the required packages as mentioned in the Installation section.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file `Sabermtr.ipynb`.

## Usage

The Jupyter Notebook contains the code for data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling. It is divided into sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the analysis. You can run the code cells sequentially to observe the results and generate the visualizations.

The notebook utilizes the pandas library to work with data frames and the plotly and matplotlib libraries for creating visualizations. It also uses statsmodels for statistical modeling.

The project includes a CSV file, `hofbatting.csv`, which contains the Hall of Fame batting data. This data is used for analysis and visualization.

## Visualizations

The notebook includes various visualizations of the baseball data, including bar charts, scatter plots, and regression models. These visualizations provide insights into different aspects of baseball performance and trends.
